Enabling IIS (Internet Information Services) turns a Windows machine into a web server, allowing it to host websites and web applications by serving static and dynamic content over HTTP/HTTPS. It provides features like authentication, logging, security, and application pools for better resource management. Enabling CGI (Common Gateway Interface) within IIS allows the server to execute external scripts, such as Perl, Python, or PHP, to generate dynamic content in response to user requests. This is useful for running legacy applications, processing form data, and interacting with databases. Together, IIS and CGI enable a Windows server to efficiently handle web traffic and execute dynamic scripts for web applications.
